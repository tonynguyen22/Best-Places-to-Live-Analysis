# Best Places to Live in the U.S. Analysis 

## Overview

This project involved an analysis of a dataset of the best 100 places to live in the United States. The goal was to find insights related to factors like population growth, living wages for different family sizes, and how rank correlates with wages.

## Data 

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contained information on the top 100 places to live including:

- Rank
- City
- State  
- Population 2010 & 2020
- Land Area
- Density
- Living Wages for 4 family types

## Analysis

The analysis focused on answering the following key questions:

- What is the correlation between population size and living wages in the top 20 cities?
- Which cities had the highest population growth and how did that impact wages?
- How do living wages differ by family size in the top 10 places? 
- How does living wage vary by state for a typical family of 4?
- How does rank impact wages in the bottom 10 cities?

Visualizations included scatterplots, bar charts, tree maps, and maps.

## Insights  

Some key findings from the analysis:

- Single parents need much higher wages than multi-adult households
- Population growth didn't directly correlate with wage increases
- Lower ranked cities didn't necessarily have lower wages

## Limitations & Next Steps

Limitations of the dataset meant other factors like cost of living should be considered for a more thorough analysis. Additional data would provide deeper insights.

Overall, the project provided interesting high-level findings but more data is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to the best places to live.

## Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis uncovered some interesting high-level relationships between ranking, population, and wages for major US cities. While the findings are limited due to data constraints, this project provided a solid foundation for approaches to analyze livability factors in US cities. Further analysis with additional datasets could lead to more robust insights into the drivers of quality of life across different locations.
